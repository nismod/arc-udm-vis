It is home to 3.7 million people, generating over 2 million jobs and contributing over £110 billion of annual Gross Value Added (GVA) to the UK economy per year. The area also contains some of the fastest growing and most productive towns and cities in the UK.</p><div><div style="display:inline-block"><div class="inputComponent"><h4 class="inputLabel" id="density">Density</h4><select options="[object Object],[object Object]" class="customSelect"><option selected="" value="population">Population</option><option value="employment">Employment</option></select></div></div><div style="display:inline-block"><div class="inputComponent"><h4 class="inputLabel" id="transport">Transport</h4><select options="[object Object],[object Object]" class="customSelect"><option value="rail">Railways and Stations</option><option selected="" value="roads">Roads</option></select></div></div><div style="display:inline-block"><div class="inputComponent"><h4 class="inputLabel" id="boundary">Boundary</h4><select options="[object Object],[object Object],[object Object]" class="customSelect"><option value="county">County Councils and Unitary Authorities</option><option value="lad">Local Authority Districts (LAD)</option><option selected="" value="msoa">Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA)</option></select></div></div></div><div><div style="width:100%"></div></div><h2 id="future-development-scenarios">Future Development Scenarios</h2><p>A <a href="https://nic.org.uk/studies-reports/growth-arc/">report</a> published in 2018 by the National Infrastructure Commission outlined substantial plans to increase access and connectivity within the Arc area by 2050. This vision includes one million new homes across the Arc, major improvements to rail routes, and potentially an East-West Expressway road.</p><p>Through computer-based simulations, researchers at the University of Oxford and Newcastle University explored possible futures of the Arc in order to learn more about how this vision would impact the built and natural environment.</p><p>Two scenarios were identified to guide the broad location of new urban development.</p><h3 id="expansion-of-existing-settlements">Expansion of existing settlements</h3><ul><li>Location of development near <strong>existing settlements</strong>, with <strong>good access</strong> <!-- -->to existing employment by road or rail</li><li>Allow some building on <strong>green belt land</strong> <!-- -->around existing settlements</li></ul><h3 id="new-settlements">New Settlements</h3><ul><li>Focussed on <strong>new centres</strong>, around future <strong>railway stations</strong></li></ul><p>
